# Visualization of APEX model outputs
Visualizations of biomass outputs from the APEX model and comparison to field data and remote sensing results.

## Data Types
* .SAD = biomass output file from APEX
  * Biomass should be the sum of STL + STD + GZSLkg/ha + GZSD/ha
  * STL = standing live (Mg/ha)
  * STD = standing dead (Mg/ha)
  * GZSLkg/ha = standing live grazed (kg/ha)
  * GZSDkg/ha = standing dead grazed (kg/ha)
  * A_DDM = plant daily growth after accounting for plant stress (Mg/ha)
  * BIOM = total above and belowground biomass, doesn't include dead material (Mg/ha)

* CARM Biomass
  * Biomass clipped from grazing exclosure cages (kg/ha) for each plant functional group
  * Cages are moved at the end of each growing season
  
* PastID_ecosite
  * Identifying information for each pasture subarea
  
 * Remote Sensing Data
   * CPER NDVI
   * CPER biomass mean: biomass estimates derived from NDVI by Sean Kearney (kg/ha)
